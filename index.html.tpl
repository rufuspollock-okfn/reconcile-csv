<h1>Reconcile-CSV</h1>
<p>Do you know this? Someone hands you two spreadsheets and says: This two
contain data that are about the same things: mash them up. The only
problem: The data is messy as hell, unique identifiers? Never heard of.
</p>
<p>This is where Reconcile-CSV steps in. It's an <a
href="http://openrefine.org">OpenRefine</a> reconciliation server running
of a CSV file - right now you're accessing it.</p>
<p>To start reconciling: add <i>http://localhost:8000/reconcile</i> as a
reconciliation service in Refine and go ahead</p>
